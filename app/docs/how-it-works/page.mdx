# How It Works

The system operates as a two-phase AI pipeline. Here's what actually happens when you submit a concept.

## Phase 1 — Concept Intelligence (Ideation Engine)

When you submit a raw concept — even something as sparse as *"dry, cracked heels"* — the system doesn't pass that directly to generation. It first runs your concept through the **Ideation Engine**, a strategic interpretation layer that transforms your input into a high-performance generation directive.

The Ideation Engine:
- Rewrites your concept as a fully specified, native-style prompt
- Appends emotional resonance tags calibrated to the problem state
- Locks in the lo-fi, iPhone-native aesthetic as a hard constraint
- Generates 3–4 **prompt variations** (different lighting, angles, emotional tones, crop perspectives) so you have options without doing the work yourself
- Surfaces 2–3 **adjacent concepts** — related creative angles you may not have considered

This phase runs automatically when you provide a text concept. If you've already attached reference images, the system can skip ideation and move directly to generation using your visual references as context.

## Phase 2 — Generative Quality Loop

Once the concept is sharpened, the system enters the **Generative Quality Loop** — a closed-loop generation and review cycle that runs autonomously.

### Step 1: Generate
The system submits the enhanced prompt to the image generation engine with your configured settings (aspect ratio, resolution, output format).

### Step 2: Review

Before the image ever surfaces to you, an AI review agent evaluates the output against a 7-point Native Ad Quality Standard:

| Criterion | What It's Checking |
|---|---|
| UGC Authenticity | Does it look like a real person posted this, or does it look like a brand made it? |
| Lo-Fi Aesthetic | Is the iPhone/natural-light aesthetic visible — grain, imperfect framing, real-world lighting? |
| Emotional Hook | Is there a visceral, relatable, scroll-stopping emotional quality? |
| Concept Fidelity | Does the image actually depict what was asked for? |
| Technical Integrity | No AI artifacts — no mangled anatomy, impossible geometry, garbled text |
| Compositional Accuracy | Does the framing match the requested aspect ratio correctly? |
| Social Plausibility | Would a real person plausibly post this to their feed? |

### Step 3: Pass or Retry

Each criterion is scored 0 or 1. The total determines what happens next:

- **6–7 points** → Image passes. Delivered to you.
- **4–5 points** → Marginal. System refines the prompt and retries automatically.
- **0–3 points** → Fails. System rewrites the prompt, addressing the specific failure points, and regenerates.

The system runs up to **3 full generation attempts** per request. It won't pass a failing image just to finish quickly. If the image doesn't meet standard after three attempts, you'll know — and you can refine your input.

**This loop is invisible to you.** You submit a concept. You get back an image that has already been validated.
