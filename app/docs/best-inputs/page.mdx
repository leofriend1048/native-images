# Getting the Best Results

The quality of your output is directly tied to the specificity of your input.

## Be Specific About the Problem State

The system is optimized for problem-state visuals. The more precisely you describe the *specific manifestation* of the problem, the better the output.

| Weak Input | Strong Input |
|---|---|
| "Skin problem" | "Irritated jawline skin — red, bumpy, the aftermath" |
| "Hair loss" | "Thinning hair visible on scalp, overhead shot, morning bathroom light" |
| "Stomach issue" | "Bloated stomach vs. flat stomach, side by side comparison" |
| "Eye bags" | "Puffy under-eye bags, close-up, morning light, no makeup" |

## Specify the Visual Context

Tell the system *where* this is happening. Bathroom mirror? Morning light? In bed? On a tile floor? Environmental context makes generated images more specific and more credible.

## Use the Variation Output Strategically

When the Ideation Engine returns variations, don't ignore them. These are pre-validated prompt alternatives with different emotional registers and compositional angles. Test multiple variations against each other — the one that resonates in the feed often isn't the one that sounds most compelling in text.

## Attach Reference Images to Anchor Style

If you have high-performing existing creatives, attach them as references. The system can read the visual style, lighting quality, and compositional framing of your reference images and use them to shape generation. You can attach up to 14 reference images per generation.

## Think in Emotional Tags

When describing your concept, mentally ask: *what does this feel like?* Suffering? Relief? Shock? Recognition? The more you can articulate the emotional register you're targeting, the more precisely the system can generate to it.

## Concept Categories That Perform Well

Based on the strategic logic the system is built around, these concept types consistently produce strong native creative:

- **Close-up problem states** — Skin texture, scalp visibility, dental discoloration, joint inflammation
- **Before/after contrasts** — Side-by-side or sequential depictions of a condition and its resolution
- **Morning/bathroom contexts** — Natural lighting, no-makeup, in-the-moment authenticity
- **Involuntary body moments** — Bloating, puffiness, redness, swelling — things that happen *to* people
- **Tactile textures** — Dry skin, cracked surfaces, rough texture — visuals that feel physical
