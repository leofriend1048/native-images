# Access & Team Management

Access to the system is invite-only. Workspace administrators manage user accounts and control who can access the platform. There are no self-registration flows — all access is granted through an admin-issued invite link.

## What This System Is Not

This system is not a general-purpose image generator. It is not built for lifestyle photography, hero shots, or brand identity work.

It is purpose-built for one job: generating the kind of raw, emotionally resonant, authentically ugly problem-state visuals that outperform polished creative in Meta ad auctions. Every constraint in the system — the lo-fi aesthetic enforcement, the UGC quality checks, the emotional tagging layer, the retry logic — exists because that job has specific, measurable requirements that generic image generation ignores.

Feed it the right concepts. It will do the rest.
