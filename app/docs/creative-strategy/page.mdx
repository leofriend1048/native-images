## The Scroll-Stop Hierarchy

Not all visual triggers are equal. These are ranked by how reliably they arrest a thumb mid-scroll:

1. **Skin texture in extreme close-up** — Pores, bumps, redness, flaking. The camera distance matters. A mid-shot of a face doesn't stop anyone. A macro shot of irritated skin does.
2. **The involuntary grimace** — Pain, discomfort, frustration captured mid-expression. Candid, not posed. The moment someone is reacting to their problem, not aware they're being photographed.
3. **Asymmetry or contrast** — One eye more swollen than the other. One side of a scalp noticeably thinner. Visual asymmetry reads as "real" because real problems aren't symmetrical.
4. **Tactile implication** — Images that make the viewer feel a texture. Dry, cracked lip skin. Rough heel callus. The brain simulates touch from visual alone.
5. **Scale disruption** — Something shown at unexpected scale. A hair follicle clogged with sebum. A cuticle in extreme close-up. The unfamiliarity forces the eye to pause and interpret.

## Lighting as a Trust Signal

The right lighting is the single fastest way to make a generated image read as native vs. produced.

| Lighting Type | What It Signals | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Harsh overhead bathroom fluorescent | Morning routine, unfiltered | Skin, hair, dental |
| Soft window light from one side | Real-life, low-effort | Face, body |
| Phone flashlight, slight overexposure | Late-night, impulsive capture | Pain moments, urgency |
| No fill, natural shadows | Authentic, unmanipulated | Everything |
| Even studio lighting | Brand, commercial | **Avoid** |

**Rule:** If the lighting looks like someone set it up, it's wrong.

## The Ugliness Principle

The single most counterintuitive thing about native creative: **the uglier the problem, the better it performs.**

Brands instinctively want to soften. Slightly red skin. Mild puffiness. Tasteful close-ups. This instinct kills performance. The creative that stops the scroll is the one that shows the problem in its most unfiltered, most uncomfortable, most visceral form.

The viewer's reaction is not disgust — it's recognition. *That's exactly what mine looks like.* That moment of recognition is the only thing that makes someone stop and read your copy.

Push the ugliness further than feels comfortable. The system is built to handle it.

## Framing Angles That Work

Most brand photography defaults to eye-level, centered subjects. Native ads that perform use different framing:

- **POV (point of view)** — Shot from the person's own perspective, looking down at their body. The viewer inhabits the perspective.
- **Overhead / bird's eye** — Scalp shots, skin sprawled on a surface, body layout. Creates intimacy and specificity.
- **Extreme close-up, slightly off-center** — Not a beauty close-up. A forensic close-up. The imperfection fills the frame.
- **Mirror shot** — Someone looking at their own problem in a bathroom mirror. The viewer sees both the person and the reflection.
- **Half and half** — Literal split of problem vs. result, or two contrasting states sharing one frame.

## The Before Without the After

A common mistake: showing the before-and-after as a paired ad creative. It doesn't work as well as showing the *before alone*.

The before-and-after resolves the tension. The viewer sees the solution and moves on. A before image alone creates an open loop — the problem is visible, the solution is absent, and the viewer's brain is primed to seek resolution. That's when your copy steps in.

Use the system to generate problem-state-only images. Save the after for your landing page.

## Aspect Ratio as a Creative Decision

Aspect ratio isn't just a technical setting — it changes what the image communicates.

| Ratio | Feed Placement | Creative Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **4:5** | Meta Feed (primary) | Portrait crops force intimacy. Good for faces and body close-ups. |
| **9:16** | Stories / Reels | Full-screen immersion. Extreme close-ups become overwhelming — use this intentionally. |
| **1:1** | Feed (square) | Balanced compositions. Works for split comparisons and texture grids. |
| **3:2** | Landscape (rare in feed) | Gives context, shows environment. Good for bathroom/room settings. |

For problem-state creatives, **4:5 is the default for a reason** — the vertical crop fills the feed and eliminates environmental context that dilutes focus.

## Testing Logic: What to Variable Test

When the system returns 3–4 variations, here's how to think about which ones to test against each other:

**Test 1: Emotional register**
Take two variations at opposite ends of the emotional spectrum — the most clinical/forensic vs. the most visceral/suffering. These will speak to different sub-audiences in your target.

**Test 2: Framing angle**
Close-up vs. contextual. The close-up maximises recognition. The contextual shot (person in their environment) builds relatability.

**Test 3: Moment of problem**
The problem happening vs. the aftermath of the problem. A rash in progress vs. raw, irritated skin the morning after. Both work for different copy angles.

Don't test too many variables at once. Pick one axis, generate variations along it, let the data tell you which emotional register your audience responds to.

## Copy-Creative Alignment

The image alone doesn't close. The creative's job is to make someone stop. The copy's job is to make them click. They need to be aligned.

| Image Type | Copy Angle That Pairs With It |
|---|---|
| Extreme close-up problem state | "You know exactly what this feels like" — direct recognition copy |
| POV shot looking down at problem | First-person framing — "I tried everything before I found..." |
| Before/comparison image | Question hook — "Why does one side look completely different?" |
| Mirror shot (person seeing their problem) | Empathy hook — "Most people just accept it. You don't have to." |
| Texture macro | Curiosity hook — "This is what a dermatologist actually sees" |

Generate your image first. Write copy that finishes the story the image starts.
